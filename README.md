# Experience 2020 - Sample Global Custom Tool
This repo provides the code used to demonstrate the Global Custom Tool feature during the **Personalizing the LO Experience** session at the Ellie Mae Virtual Experience 2020. The tool demonstrates how to create a global Loan Search capability within LO Connect/Encompass Web.

To use the tool, you will need to place the HTML, CSS, JS and JPG files onto a publicly accessible web server. You will then set up the tool within the LO Connect Admin Portal, under the `Customizations > Custom Tools` section.
